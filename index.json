    "brief": "As a SysAdmin, I focused my professional career to work with Public Cloud (specially AWS).  Since I discovered the Cloud, I knew that this was what I wanted to learn and dedicate professionally.  Every day, arrive new technologies and improvements that enhance the Cloud, such as Terraform and Kubernetes, which I love to learn and use in my day to day.  I am originally from Menorca. And I have had many work experiences from other fields (specially tourism/restauration) that make me grow as a person that knows what he wants. However, since that I could study Systems Administration, I found in this job my true vocation and knew that this was what I wanted to dedicate professionally. I am really motivated to keep growing and learning.  One of my personal interests are videogames, they have been with me my whole life, and I really enjoy playing a good story to evade myself from the world; I also like to play boardgames, it's a hobby that I like to share with friends and with my girlfriend; I love pets, I have 3 cats and a dog; TV series (I completed Netflix); Cinema, specially Marvel Superheroes (not DC, well... I enjoyed the Batman trilogy of Christopher Nolan); and that is a bit of me.  I consider myself a responsible person, proactive and I enjoy teamwork, especially with good and professional people."
